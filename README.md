# 👋 Hey! I'm Milena — a career switcher diving headfirst into the world of **DevOps** and **Python development**, driven by curiosity, consistency, and the thrill of building systems that work beautifully.

💻 Currently focused on:
- **Linux fundamentals** and terminal fluency  
- **Shell scripting** for automations and infrastructure tasks  
- **Git and GitHub** for version control and collaboration  
- **CI/CD** pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins coming soon)  
- **Containerization** with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes  
- **Cloud fundamentals** with AWS  
- **Python scripting** for backend logic and automation  
- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform and Ansible

🚀 Projects in progress:
- `script-backup`: automated backup with Shell and crontab  
- `devops-journey`: my full learning roadmap + labs + notes  
- Python mini-projects: CLI tools, automation scripts, and data wrangling

📚 Platforms I’m learning from:
- Udemy (DevOps: Automação sem Enrolação)  
- DIO | Danki Code | 100 Days of Python Bootcamp  
- Docs, blogs, RFCs and real-world practice
