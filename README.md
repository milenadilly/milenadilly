🎯 Full Stack Developer Jr | JavaScript | React.js | Java | Clean Code | UI Thinking | API Integration

Hi! I’m Milena — a full stack developer passionate about building scalable, user-centric applications that combine clean interfaces with solid back-end architecture. I bring a unique perspective from my background in Customer Success and process optimization, ensuring both technical quality and business value.

Currently focused on advancing my full stack skills with JavaScript (ES6+), React for the front-end, and Java for robust back-end development. I’m building real-world projects that integrate RESTful APIs, responsive UI, and clean, maintainable code — from front to back.

## 🔍 In Progress

Building full stack applications using React and Java (Spring Boot), with emphasis on:
- REST API development & integration  
- Authentication and data persistence  
- UI/UX best practices and accessibility  
- Code quality, version control, and testing  

You’ll also find earlier projects in Python and DevOps — part of my broader tech journey and continuous learning mindset.
