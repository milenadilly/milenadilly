🎯 Front-End Developer Jr | JavaScript | React | HTML & CSS | Clean Code & UI Thinking

Hi! I’m Milena — a front-end developer passionate about building user-centric, responsive, and accessible web applications. With a background in Customer Success and tech-driven process optimization, I bring an analytical mindset and a strong eye for usability to everything I build.

Currently focused on deepening my front-end stack with JavaScript (ES6+), React, Git and CSS architecture. I'm building practical projects and interfaces that solve real-world problems and deliver value through clean, intuitive design.
